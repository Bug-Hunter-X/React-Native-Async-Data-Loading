# React Native Asynchronous Data Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access properties of an object before it's fully loaded from an asynchronous operation (e.g., API call).  The solution shows how to properly handle asynchronous data to prevent `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined` errors.

## Bug Description
The bug is triggered when the component tries to render before the data has been fetched successfully, leading to undefined values being accessed.

## Solution
The solution uses the `useEffect` hook with a state variable to manage the loading and availability of data.  The component renders loading state initially and only displays the fetched data once it's available.  This prevents the error by ensuring data access only occurs after it is loaded.
